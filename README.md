# making-food
We can treat scheduler requests as food consumers, and host manager as the food maker. When there are 5 consumers asking for food, the maker only makes 1 food instead of 5. And the consumers want the food as fresh as possible, so the maker only start to make food when the waiting list is not empty.

Just run `python food_maker_game.py` and see.
